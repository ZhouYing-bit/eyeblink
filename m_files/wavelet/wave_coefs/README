Files:

==== conv.rb, wavelets_coeffs.h ====

The h file contains the wavelet filter coefficients for various wavelets. It is
a copy of the file used in the PyWavelets project (http://pybytes.com/pywavelet
/index.html) which comes with a license reproduced at the head of that file.

The conv.rb file processes the wavelets_coeffs.h file to produce the .m files
that populate this directory.

==== .m files ====

These are matlab scripts that, when run, will load coefficients for the wavelets
of the files' namesakes into four variables: Lo_D, Hi_D, Lo_R, Hi_R, each
corresponding to a low or high pass filter to be used in the deconstruction or
reconstruction fast discrete wavelet transform.
